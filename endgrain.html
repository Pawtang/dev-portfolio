        <h2>Circumstance</h2>
        <p>Luck brought me across a free piece of mystery wood. I had no idea what it was, but I knew I wanted to make something with it.</p>

        <h2>End-grain</h2>
        <p>cutting boards are made by cutting a solid piece of wood into narrower strips,  turning each of those strips up on their ends, and joining them together. This allows the inner grain to be displayed, and creates the elegant symmetry. Additionally, it helps provide a harder cutting surface that lasts much longer.</p>

    <h2>Finishing</h2>
    <p>After everything was joined and shaped, the board took a few turns through the drum sander to remove any remaining wood glue runout and minimal surface deviance. I finished with several passes of hand sanding with a fine grit.</br></br> I researched various sealing and finishing options and ended up choosing a mix of beeswax and mineral oil that gave the board a nice rich gold finish. I applied 4 coats to the board and let it rest for 24 hours before its initial use. I had to reapply the finish after a few days of use, but the second application has held up much more as it has permeated the wood.</p>
