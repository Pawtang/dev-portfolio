        <h2>Hail Protection Project</h2>
        <p>Our project, sponsored by Ally, was to create a hail protection system that could protect the outdoor cars at a dealership from hail.</br></br> The constraints were to deploy the system within under a minute per car, withstand wind up to 40mph, protect against hail up to 4", and minimize cost. We had to consider additional variables, such as the various layouts of parking lots, and design something that could accomodate any possible layout.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>After some prototyping, we decided the best design was a very simple one; telescoping poles that could be deployed to support a net that covered  whole section of cars at once. This would cut down on our deployment time per car drastically, and minimized the actions needed to deploy full protection.</br></br>
          We then had to calculate the proper diameter and other parameters of the supporting poles. This would depend on the weight of the pole itself, the impact of hail on the supported net, and the subsequent inward tension of the net between poles.

        <h2></h2>
        <p>It turned out that calculating the sag of the net - modeled as a two-dimensional catenary curve - was a complicated process that would involve finding inherent properties of the net material. To do this, we designed and ran an experiment with various loads. This gave us a linear relationsip between net load and the distance it sagged, which allowed us to determine the minimum clearance between the cars and the net.

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>Our design required some permanent infrastructure to be put in place in order to ease the deployment process. Steel cylindrical housing would be embedded into the concrete base of the parking lot to hold the telescoping tubes. When it comes time to deploy, they would simply be opened up and the poles extended for use.
